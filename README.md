# E4Nu Comparisons

This reposiory allows for quick comparison against e4nu data using neutrino event generators on electron mode. The only requirement is for the generated events to be stored in NuHEPMC format. The available data is stored in the data repository. There is a simple macro with the corresponding kinematic cuts used to compare the simulations against data.
